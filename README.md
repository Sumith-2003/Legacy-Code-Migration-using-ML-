Developed an AI-driven solution to automate the migration of legacy code from Delphi, Cobol and VB to modern technologies such as C and Java, significantly reducing manual effort and errors. It utilizes machine learning models such as Deep Q-learning and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to analyze and translate legacy code snippets. The application features a chatbot powered by the GPT-3 API to assist users with code documentation and queries.

## Features
